# Encryptor
A password encryptor package for  Linux

>Complete revamp coming soon!
>This is a powerful software to be used only at user's risk.
>RSA and AES encrytion techniques ensure that your data is secure and safe. 
>A menu driven program to easily begin using The Encryptor.
>It takes one username and password at a time and encrypts them in a secure file. Further versions will see an addition to the number of pairs that can be added.
>The method ensures that while sending any credentials to authorised users, only they have the access to it.
>Adding such methods allows you to provide true end to end encryption, without revealing any sensitive info.
>Some features are explained below
#### Steps to run:
1. Install Python 3.x on your Windows/Linux/Mac machine
2. Install the virtual environment package 
```sh
$ pip install virtualenv
```
3. Create a new virtual environment and activate it
```sh
$ virtualenv venv

For Windows:
$ venv\Scripts\activate
For Linux:
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required dependencies in the `venv`
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the `source.py` file
```sh
$ py source.py
```

### Understanding The Encryptor
  - The Encryptor uses AES and RSA encryption.

  - Optimal asymmetric encryption padding used for sturdier encryption.
  - 'Nonce' to ensure AES encryption.
